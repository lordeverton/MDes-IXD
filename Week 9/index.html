        <p>This is where I was experimenting with the rocket turning around after it hit the end of the image</p>

        <p>I found someone's fire effect that could be an interesting effect for the "rocket", so I decided to play with the positioning and size and import it to my project</p>
        <p>Adjusting the class X and Y position, and flipping the VX and VY to the opposites and turning one of them negative made the fire disperse from left to right, instead of bottom to top.</p>
