        <ol>- My goal was to build off the tutorial of the tree and create a scene with a house and white picket fence.</ol>
        <img src="blender-scene-2.png" height="600"></img>
        <ol>- As I look at the scene, I think placing the "sky" further away would give it more depth. Right now, it looks like the house is ontop of a cliff!</ol>
        <img src="blender-scene-3.png" height="600"></img>
        <ol>- I played around with the Set Active View to Camera setting to create some more interesting angles.</ol>
        <ol>- In further iterations, I'd play around with the spacing of the planes, lighting, and add more details to my house. Right now, there is a door, but no doornob, there are not windows either. </ol>
