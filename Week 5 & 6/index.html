        <ol>- My goal was to build a warehouse that represents the warehouse where my product will live.</ol>
        <ol>- Additionally, the product is built for print operators, so I wanted to show users actually engaging with the tool.</ol>

        <ol>- I used some pre-made models to speed up the process.</ol>
        <ol>- Some of the models required some adjustments. The warehouse racks, for example, were grouped together.</ol>

        <ol>- Struggled to get lighting right. Initially my renders were completely black, so I assumed it was because there was no lighting applied.</ol>
