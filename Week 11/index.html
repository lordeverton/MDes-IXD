        <ol>- My goal was to create a bunsen burner type emulator that could be controlled by a slider.</ol>
        <ol>- Fire particles are strong at the source of the fuel and then gets progressively weaker. I used particle size and transparency to visualize the strength of the temperature.</ol>
        <ol>- From a technical perspective, I used the alpha() method to decrement transparency and decremented the diameter until alpha reached zero.</ol>
        <ol>- After alpha reached zero, I used the splice method to remove the particle from the array.</ol>
        <ol>- In my next iteration I would like to create another UI input that modifies the the air holes, which would change the color of the gas burner from orange to light blue.</ol>
