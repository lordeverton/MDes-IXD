        <h1>Prototype Readings</h1>
        <p><b>“We have proposed a shift in attention to focus on questions about the design of the artifact itself: What role will it play in a users life? How should it look and feel? How should it be implemented? The model that we have introduced can be used by designers to divide any design problem into these three classes of questions, each of which may benefit from a different approach to prototyping.”</b></p>
        <p>The role approach is useful if the artifact provides more functionality to the user. The look and feel prototype is used if the role is well understood, but the goal of the artifact is to present functionality in a novel way. Lastly, the implementation prototype is used if the artifact’s functionality is based on a new technique. </p>
        <p><b>“Designers make such prototypes to visualize different look and feel possibilities for themselves and their design teams. They ask users to interact with them to see how the look and feel could be improved.”</b></p>
        <p>When researching the results of these look and feel prototypes, I’d expect to still maintain a quantitative approach. For example, with an improvement to a part of our ecommerce website, there’s a form that was difficult to read and wasn’t scannable. The prototype fixed this issue and didn’t really modify the functionality, but users were able to find information quickly and easily. I previously thought that the prototype was more of a implementation change.</p>
        <p><b>“Digital products allow users to interact with their content, and take advantage of motion and animation. Furthermore, digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions.”</b></p>
        <p>While there are new dimensions we can take advantage of as designers, such as animations and motion, we still use techniques developed by illustrators when digital devices were not available. Consider the 12 basic animation principles written in the 1930s—these principles are used in developing how digital products are designed. The fascinating part of our current generation is that we can interact with digital devices and see dynamic content based on what we do. This means the experiences we create can be more nuanced, communicate more, but also means that the small, tiny, details all matter.</p>
