        <ol>- I wanted to create a emotion detection algorithm that could convert your facial expression into an emoji.</ol>
        <ol>- The use case is for WhatsApp and other communication applications to automatically detect your emotion and respond quicker</ol>
        <ol>- The benefit to this is a better user experience and more engagement from your user base</ol>
        <ol>- I created a function that detected the distance between your lips and if it was greater than 25 pixels, it triggered an image to load</ol>
        <ol>- The image is a smiley face that is placed over your face using the faceOval parameters</ol>
